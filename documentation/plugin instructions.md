## How to Use the Zip Recipes Plugin ##

1. Once you’ve installed the Zip Recipes Plugin, click “Add New” under Posts on the left-hand navigation bar. When you’re on the “Add New Post” screen you’ll see an icon on the far right hand side of the styles row that looks like a spoon and fork. Click that button to start your first recipe post.

2. An “Add a Recipe” box will pop up for you to enter or cut/paste the recipe title and image, as well as your ingredients and instructions. The recipe image should be entered as a URL (http://www.imageurl.com)

3. If you are adding a recipe that has a secondary recipe, maybe for a sauce or a glaze, pay special attention. Add ingredients for the main recipe, then start the next line with an exclamation point to create a label, like `!For the Sauce`. Then, add the ingredients for the secondary recipe.

4. Next, if you scroll down, you can also click “More Options” to enter more details, like rating, prep time, cook time, serving size and yield. Click the “Add Recipe” button when you are done.5. If you need to edit your recipe after you’ve clicked “Add Recipe,” simply click the spoon and fork icon again on the visual editor toolbar. When a recipe is inserted in a post, you will see an image like the one below where you enter post details, but again, to make edits to a recipe, click the spoon and fork icon on the toolbar. You can no longer edit or delete a recipe by clicking the placeholder image below.

Just like the big recipe sites, such as AllRecipes.com and FoodNetwork.com, your recipes can also show up in the Rich Snippets format within Google Recipe Search with a photo, ingredients, cook time and ratings.
	
## Special Feature #1: Add Links within Ingredients or Instructions ##
Adding a link is easy. Whether you want to link out to Amazon to let your readers purchase ingredients or kitchen equipment, or you want to provide links to related recipes. Now you can do this from within the Ingredients, Instructions and Summary fields. Here’s what you do:

- To add linked text, include both the word or phrase to be linked and the URL within brackets with a divider in between. Example: `[margarine|http://www.parkay.com]`

	Here's how Ingredients will appear in your actual blog post:

## Special Feature #2: Add Images within Recipe Instructions ##
We know that many food bloggers like to incorporate images into their step-by-step recipe instructions (some of you also like to include images within their ingredients list). Now you can do the same with the Zip Recipes Plugin. Here’s what you do:

- To add images between each recipe instruction, simply press enter after each instruction (__very important__). Then, add the image link preceded by a percentage sign. See example below.

## Special Feature #3: Add Labels within Recipe Instructions ##
There are certain recipes that have a secondary recipe, like a salad and salad dressing. The Zip Recipes Plugin now enables you to create labels to let readers know which steps are for which recipe.

- Simply enter your instructions for the main recipe, then start the next line with an exclamation point to create a label, like `!For the Salad Dressing`. Then, add the instructions for the secondary recipe.

## Special Feature #4: Enhance Recipe Content with Bold and Italics ##
The Zip Recipes Plugin now makes it possible to bold or italicize words or phrases within the Ingredients, Instructions and Summary sections. Simply type in your recipe as you normally do, but for bold, enclose the word(s) in asterisks. For italics, enclose the word(s) in underscores. See example:

Here’s what the Ingredients section of your recipe will look like when you post to your blog:

## Adjusting Your Settings ##
1. From your WordPress dashboard, scroll to the very bottom of the page and click Zip Recipes Plugin on the left-hand side.
![](http://i.imgur.com/QaQZZK5.png)
2. This will open a page called “Zip Recipes Plugin Settings,” and from here you’ll be able to customize the output of your recipe plugin in several ways. Let’s take a look at each. If you choose to make any changes, be sure to click the blue “Save Changes” button at the bottom of the page when you are finished. Any changes you make here will be reflected across all recipes posted on your site using the Zip Recipes Plugin.
3. Custom Print Button. If you changed the look of the Print button (or plan to do so), you’ll need to enter the image URL for the custom button in the space provided. If you plan to use standard Print text link, just leave this field blank.4. Zip Recipes Plugin Link. If you keep this box unchecked, a line will appear at the bottom of your recipe posts in light colored text that reads “Schema/Recipe SEO Data Markup by Zip Recipes Plugin.”
5. Printed Output: Recipe Permalink. If you leave this box unchecked, the URL for the specific recipe post will appear at the very bottom of the print version of the recipe.
6. Printed Output: Copyright Statement. Here you have the opportunity to enter a copyright notice, the URL for your blog, or anything else you’d like to see appear at the bottom of the print version of your recipe posts.7. In the General section, you’ll see Stylesheet. Only uncheck this box if you or a designer are working on a fully customized stylesheet to use with the recipe plugin (most plugin users will leave this box checked).8. Recipe Title. If you leave this unchecked, you will see a title in the main body of your post. If you check the box, the black title to the left of the “Print” button below will disappear. The title will continue to appear on the print version of your recipes.
9. Print Button. If you leave this unchecked, you’ll see a “Print” button to the right of the recipe title, enabling your readers to print out your recipe as a recipe card.
10. Image Width lets you set the appropriate size to match the width of your blog post. All of your recipe posts will size photos the same way based on this setting.11. Image Display has two options. First, check the “Don’t show image in post” option box and the image will not appear in your blog post. It then has the potential to be picked up by search engines like Google and Bing. Second, leave “Don’t show image in print view” checked and the recipe image will not appear when users print out your recipe.
12. Border Style. Here you have the opportunity to add a solid, dotted, dashed, thick solid or double black line around the entire recipe. The default is set to none if you do not wish to have any kind of border around your recipe.13. Ingredients and Instructions. Here you have the option to change the label (e.g., if you prefer to refer to “Instructions” as “Directions”) or hide the label altogether by checking the “Don’t Show” boxes. Additional options include how the information is displayed: bulleted list, numbered list, etc.
14. In the Other Options section you’ll find options to change labels for rating, cook time, yield, notes and more. These are all optional so you don’t need to include any of them in your posts. However, if you want your posts to show up in Google Recipe Search in the Rich Snippets format, you will need to include at least two of the following fields: prep time, cook time, total time, calories, rating and/or image.
